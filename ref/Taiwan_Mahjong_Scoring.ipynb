    "- **Dealing:** At the start of each round, players draw tiles four times (4 tiles each time). The dealer draws one extra tile for a total of 17 tiles, while non-dealers have 16.\n",
    "- **Supplementing Flowers:** The dealer must supplement their flower tiles first and announce \"Please\" (請). The next player can then supplement their flowers and announce \"Please\", and so on. The dealer can only discard their first tile after the last player has supplemented their flowers and announced \"Please\".\n",
    "- **Declaring a Win:** When winning, you must not mix the winning tile into your hand. It must be kept separate on the side; otherwise, the win is invalid.\n",
    "- **Passing a Win (`過水`):** If you are waiting for multiple tiles (e.g., 3, 6, 9 of Circles) and an opponent discards one of them (e.g., 6 of Circles) which you choose not to win from, you cannot win for the remainder of that turn cycle. This applies to both self-drawn wins and winning from another player's discard. You may win again only after your next turn begins. This rule prevents players from selectively targeting others.\n",
    "- **Calling Sets:** After an opponent discards, if you want to claim the tile for a 'Sheung' (上, Chow), you must first place the claimed tile in front of you, reveal your other two tiles that form the Chow, and then discard a tile. After you discard, other players cannot 'Peng' the tile you just discarded.\n",
    "- **Turn Flow:** After a player discards, the next player in sequence can draw a tile, unless someone calls 'Peng' or 'Kong' on the discard.\n",
    "- **No Penalty for 'Broken Bridge' (`斷橋`):** This is a game for entertainment; there is no penalty for 'Broken Bridge' (a house rule term)."

    "- **'Grass' Tile (一台草):** For each 'Grass' tile (a specific bonus tile), receive two base units from each of the other three players.\n",
    "- **Concealed Kong (暗摃):** Receive one base unit from each of the other three players. The Kong must be revealed at the end of the hand; otherwise, it's a penalty of two base units per player.\n",
    "- **Chase (追):** If all four players discard the same tile in sequence, the first player to discard it pays one base unit to each of the other three players.\n",
    "- **Dealer Dice Roll (1-2-3):** If the dealer rolls a 1, 2, and 3 with the dice to start the round, they must pay one base unit to each of the other three players.\n",
    "- **Dealer Dice Roll (Triplet):** If the dealer rolls a triplet (e.g., 4-4-4) to start the round, they receive one base unit from each of the other three players.\n",
    "- **False Win (詐胡):** A player who incorrectly declares a win must pay the equivalent of a 30 Fan win to each of the other three players.\n",
    "- **Calling Peng but Not Completing:** A player who calls 'Peng' but then doesn't have a valid set must pay one base unit to the discarder."

    "- **Dealer Win:** If the dealer wins, they get an additional 1 Fan.\n",
    "- **Continuing Dealership (`拉莊`):** If the dealer wins, they remain the dealer for the next hand. This is called 'Continuing Dealership'.\n",
    "  - **1st Continuation (`連一`):** For the first consecutive win, the dealer places a die with the '1' facing up. This adds **3 Fan** to their next win.\n",
    "  - **2nd Continuation (`連二`):** For the second consecutive win, the die is turned to '2'. This adds **5 Fan**.\n",
    "  - **Formula:** The bonus Fan is calculated as `(Number of continuations x 2) + 1`. For example, a 5th continuation (`連五`) adds `5 * 2 + 1 = 11` Fan.\n",
    "- **Losing the Dealership:** If the dealer loses while there is a continuation bonus active (either by another player's self-drawn win or by discarding a winning tile), the bonus Fan is transferred to the winning player. For example, if the dealer is on a 3rd continuation (`連三`, +7 Fan bonus) and the West player wins with a 10 Fan hand by self-draw, the South and North players pay for 10 Fan, but the dealer must pay for **17 Fan** (10 + 7)."

    "Taiwan Mahjong scoring is based on a **Base Value (`底`)** plus the **Fan Value (`翻數`)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set Stakes:** Before playing, agree on the monetary value for the Base and for each Fan. If not specified, the default is **$10 Base, $1 per Fan**.\n",
    "2.  **Basic Calculation:** The payout for a winning hand is `(Fan total * Value per Fan) + Base Value`. \n",
    "    *Example:* With $10 Base and $1/Fan, a 16 Fan hand wins `(16 * $1) + $10 = $26` from the loser.\n",
    "3.  **The 'Pull' (`拉`) System:** Payments are not settled after each hand. Instead, winnings/losses are tracked and accumulate.\n",
    "    - If a player wins a second consecutive hand, the amount owed by the other players from the *previous* hand is multiplied by **1.5**, and the value of the current hand is added to it.\n",
    "    - If the previous winner loses the current hand (either by self-draw or by discarding the winning tile), their tracked winnings are **halved**.\n",

    "**Example Scenario ($10 Base, $2/Fan):**\n",
    "- **Hand 1:** East (dealer) wins with a 13 Fan self-drawn hand. South, West, and North each now owe East `$36` (`13 * $2 + $10`). This amount is tracked at their corner.\n",
    "- **Hand 2:** South discards a tile that lets East win with a 5 Fan hand.\n",
    "  - South's debt to East becomes: `($36 * 1.5) + (5 * $2 + $10) = $54 + $20 = $74`.\n",
    "  - West and North's debt remains `$36` each.\n",
    "- **Hand 3 (Possibilities):**\n",
    "  - **Scenario A:** Another player (e.g., West) wins from North's discard. East collects all tracked debts: `$74` from South, `$36` from West, and `$36` from North.\n",
    "  - **Scenario B:** East discards a tile and South wins. East's winnings from South are halved. South now only owes East `$37` (`$74 / 2`). West and North still owe East `$36` each.\n",
    "  - **Scenario C:** East wins again. The debts from Hand 2 are multiplied by 1.5, and the value of the new winning hand is added."
